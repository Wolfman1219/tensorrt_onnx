## As you can see in this repo haven't pt model. You can add pt model and convert it into onnx using ```onnx-export.py``` script. If you want to use it just run ```onxx-runtimer copy.py``` script.
## Also you can run ```Tensorrt_uchun copy.py``` script for deploy your tensorrt engine. If you haven't engine file just run ```convert_2_tensorrt.py``` and get it.
